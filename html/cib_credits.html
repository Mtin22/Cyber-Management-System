                23/02/2024 -> Basics added of HTML/CSS - (Martin) <br>
                29/02/2024 -> Experimenting with different ideas/Changed some of the elements such as Nav/Padding/Colours etc. <br>
                Added Font design - (Martin) <br>
                Linked Fontawesome with the project/Added some icons -> Also fixed a bug with one of the icons where putting the "title" element into to the "i" property would cause the assigned title to show up when clicked on it and would cause a rapid flash on the text. Fix -> Put it into the "title" element into the "a" element - (Martin) <br>
                Fixed up the footer / Added elements to the css / Changed up colours based on the group suggestion - (Martin) <br>

                11/05/2024 -> Fixed and Added verification to JavaScript (so the user cant Sign Up / Login if fields are empty or left in there default state - Previously I used the "required" statement next to the input boxes however ever since adding JS those statements are broken), Also expanded the 2FA to the Login page, Switched to Session Storage from Local Storage (hopefulyl this increases the performance a bit), Added Accessibility icons - (Martin)  <br>
